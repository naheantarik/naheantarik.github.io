        The CRM project is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for
        managing customer information. It includes a dashboard that displays key
        metrics such as the number of customers, completed tasks, and upcoming
        deadlines. Users can search for customers using various filters such as
        name, email, or phone number. Additionally, the CRM allows users to
        create and assign tasks to customers, set deadlines, and track progress.
        Each task has a status indicator that updates automatically as the task
        progresses. Users can also add notes and comments to tasks for better
        collaboration. To ensure data security, the application uses Django's
        built-in authentication system. Only authorized users can access and
        modify customer data. The project also includes automated tests to
        ensure that the application functions as intended. Overall, this CRM
        project is a great starting point for anyone looking to build a simple
        customer relationship management system using Django.
