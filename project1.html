      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to develop a Queue Management System for
        organizing queuing system that can analyze the queue. This queuing
        architecture model can switch between different scheduling algorithms
        according to the testing result i.e. the average waiting time by using
        two different queue control systems, which have developed status and
        take decision which customer to be served first. The project includes
        admin and user sides. Admin side manages and views all the management
        like user details, services, token number, serial etc. And user can
        choose their services and also payment scheme. Based on their service
        time and payment scheme user will get their token number.

        The Automated Queue Management System is design to manage certain
        customers with single department. This queuing architecture model can
        switch between different scheduling algorithms according to the testing
        result. Example the average waiting time by using two different queue
        control systems, which have developed status and take decision which
        customer to be served first.

      <h1>Requirements</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>User can choose their required payment scheme.</li>
        <li>When a user pays in full, he/her service will be paid first.</li>
        <li>When a user pays in half, he/her service will be paid second.</li>
        <li>
          If there is a free client, he will be receive his service in late.
        </li>
        <li>User will be take their token number.</li>
        <li>User will be check their serial.</li>
